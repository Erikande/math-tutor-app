# Math Tutor App

A simple web-based math tutor app built with Angular. This project is part of a QA Engineering exercise and demonstrates E2E automation, unit testing, typing strategy, and accessibility auditing.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run Cypress E2E tests:

```bash
npm run cy:run
```

## â™¿ Accessibility & Performance Audits

This project includes automated auditing using [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) and [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

### Run All Audits

```bash
npm run audit:all
```

This command runs:

* `lighthouse` against `http://localhost:4200` and saves `lh-latest.json`
* `axe-core` CLI to run a11y tests via `axe-latest.json`
* A Markdown report generator that outputs `audit/summary.md`

### View the Report

```bash
open audit/summary.md
```

This summary includes:

* âœ… Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
* ðŸ¦¯ Axe-core accessibility violations (with descriptions and counts)

> Note: Only \~20â€“50% of accessibility issues are detectable via automation. [Manual testing is always required.](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/testing)
