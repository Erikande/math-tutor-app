# 📸 UI Showcase – Responsive Proof

This document visually demonstrates the responsive layout coverage of the Math Tutor App. Screenshots were captured via Cypress using programmatic `cy.viewport()` simulation across common breakpoints.

All screenshots are real renderings from the app. See the `test-plan.md` file for viewport test descriptions and test logic.
